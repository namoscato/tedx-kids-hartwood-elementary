Mr. Yash Tahiliani is currently a fifth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. In his free time, he greatly enjoys playing soccer as well as video games. Math is his favorite subject because he finds it both entertaining as well as challenging. He wants to be an astrophysicist when he grows up one day to put those math skills to good use.
