Miss Nadia Grady is currently a fifth grader at Hartwood Elementary School. Her favorite subject is art because she can express her feelings through creative design. Outside of school, she enjoys drawing, painting and horseback riding as well as skiing. In the future, she hopes to become a teacher. Her hope is to publish a book someday about something she wishes to change in this world.
