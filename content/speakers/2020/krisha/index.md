Ms. Krisha Thaakar is currently a fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. She really enjoys anything related to math. At home, she can be seen riding her bike or playing on her hover board. When she grows up, she hopes to become a scientist. Krisha hopes to reveal to others that having a personal self and a public self is not a bad thing! We have many sides of ourselves, and we can choose which side we wish to reveal to others.
