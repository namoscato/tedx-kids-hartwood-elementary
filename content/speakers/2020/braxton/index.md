Mr. Braxton Bielawski is currently a fifth grader at Hartwood Elementary School. His favorite subjects are gym because he gets to play fun games while getting a workout. In his free time, he enjoys video games, drawing cars, creating lyrics for rap songs or just listening to them. In the future he hopes to be either a car designer, a rapper or a producer. He sometimes is okay with waiting but not all the time and so this is the reason behind his speech!
