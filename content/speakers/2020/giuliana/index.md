Ms. Giuliana Foley is currently a fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. She greatly enjoys ELA because she is able to express her feelings. Outside of school, she enjoys playing sports. The sports she enjoys playing are softball and basketball. In the future, she hopes to go to UCLA for softball and she would like to become a teacher. Something she is passionate about that relates to her speech is the importance of being able to deal with your emotions as a kid/finding ways to help yourself when you are feeling worried or overwhelmed.
