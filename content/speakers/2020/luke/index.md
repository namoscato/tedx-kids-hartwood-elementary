Mr. Luke Krushinski is a current fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. His favorite subject in school is science because he enjoys discovery. In his free time, he enjoys playing baseball and also the occasional video games. In the future he hopes to become either an MLB player or perhaps become a dentist. In his speech, he wants others to know what it is like to be the middle child in a family of three boys.
