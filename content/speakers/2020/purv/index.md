Mr. Purv Patel is a fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. He absolutely loves anything math or science related in school. His hobbies include but are not limited to soccer, skiing and building with his hands. He hopes one day to become an engineer as he loves solving complex problems and thinking critically.
