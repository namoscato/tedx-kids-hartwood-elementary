Ms. Isabella Gray is a current fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. Her interests outside of school include singing, playing the violin and art. She hopes someday she can either become a second grade teacher or perhaps a famous singer. In her speech, Bella wants others to know that art is a way to sooth the soul.
