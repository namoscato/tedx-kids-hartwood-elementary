Ms. Evelyn Owens is currently a fifth grader at Hartwood Elementary School. Her favorite subjects are math and reading because she can do them without thinking and she enjoys them! Her favorite hobbies include reading, writing, chemistry, art, gymnastics, dance and singing and poetry. In the future, I want to be a lot of things like a chemist, a doctor, an acrobat, a dancer and a journalist. She is passionate about her speech because one time her and her friends (in Maryland) had a fight and they realized that if they didn’t have each other, they wouldn’t be the same.
