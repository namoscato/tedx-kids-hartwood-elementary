Eddie is a current fourth grade student at Hartwood Elementary School. His hobbies outside of school include ice skating and gaming. In the future, he would like to be a game designer and build games when he is older. He is passionate about what he is writing because he wrote poems in third grade, and he wanted a chance to try it again.
